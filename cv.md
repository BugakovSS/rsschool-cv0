# Summary
I don't have much experience in development, but I had to quickly learn a lot of new things in the process. I started my career as an analyst. While working, I had to quickly find and study a lot of new information for data analysis. Also, while working, the analyst gained experience in using SQL, excel. SQL was used to download data for analysis, and was also used to write scripts to process data and get the final result. EXCEL was used for both data analysis and graphical presentation of data. To optimize some of the processes in excel, the VBA language was used.
At the moment, my goal is to learn a programming language for mobile development.
